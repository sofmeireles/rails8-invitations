# Rails 8 User Invitations Demo

A simple user invitation system built with Rails 8's native authentication.

## What it does

- Existing users can invite new users by email
- Invitees get a secure link to set up their password
- No open registration - invitation-only access
- Uses Rails 8's built-in authentication (no Devise)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sofmeireles/rails8-invitations.git
cd rails8-invitations
bundle install
rails db:setup
bin/dev
```

**Demo login:**
- Email: `demo@example.com`
- Password: `password`

## How it works

1. User sends invitation â†’ creates account with temp password
2. Invitee gets email with secure token link
3. They set their password and account is activated

Built using Rails' `generates_token_for` for secure, expiring tokens.
